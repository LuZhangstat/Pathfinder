# Load the MNIST digit recognition dataset into R
# http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
# assume you have all 4 files and gunzip'd them
#    [into relative subdirectory mnist/]
# creates train$n, train$x, train$y  and test$n, test$x, test$y
# e.g. train$x is a 60000 x 784 matrix, each row is one digit (28x28)
# call:  show_digit(train$x[5,])   to see a digit.
