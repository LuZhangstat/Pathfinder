At each time point,\nmultiple readings were taken from replicates and aggregated into a mean and standard deviation.\nData Dimensions:\n- totalC_t0: total carbon at t0\n- t0: initial time point\n- N_t: number of measurements\n- ts: time points [t0, tN_t]\n- eCO2mean: mean of total carbon evolved from the system since t0\n- eCO2sd: sd of total carbon evolved from the system since t0\n",
